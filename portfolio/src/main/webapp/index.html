        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Vivian, a rising sophomore at Rice University studying Computer Science. 
        </p>
        <p>At Rice, I am part of RiceApps, an organization where we code projects to improve the lives of Rice students and the greater Houston community.
          I am also a member of Torque, the women's ultimate frisbee team, which I decided to join in an effort to try something new after spending most of
          my life as a dancer. Because I have so much love for the warm and welcoming community Rice is, I am also a lunch host for prospective students, 
          and I will be welcoming new students as an advisor during our orientation week this August. I can most commonly be found at my favorite place on 
          campus, the Wiess College commons, just studying and laughing with friends. 
        </p>
        <p>Back at my home in Cupertino, California, I spend much of my time with family and friends, exploring new places and trying new boba shops. 
          When I'm not coding I'm happy to pass the time with a good book or a bike ride around the neighborhood.
        </p>

          <p id="description">Family has always been something really important to me, especially my cousins. 
            Every year, we try to get together in what we call "Cuz Unite". During Cuz Unites, 
            we go on wild adventures, play games, and just spend time catching up and enjoying 
            each other's company. Around my cousins I always feel loved and free to be myself.

          <p id="description">At Rice, students are randomly split into 11 residential colleges, which will serve as an
            inclusive community throughout their four years on campus (and beyond). My college is 
            Wiess College, and from the moment I was welcomed during orientation week it has felt 
            like home. From the friendly faces I see in commons every day to our quirky and exciting 
            traditions, I am truly grateful for my Team Family Wiess!

          <img id="img" src="/images/3.jpg" alt="Image of Europe Trip" width="504" height="378">
          <p id="description">The summer after my senior year of high school, I went on an epic month-long European vacation 
            with my family, where we visited The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Scotland, and England. It was 
            such an amazing experience to get to see and explore so many different places, and I am so  
            appreciative of my family for making it happen. Hopefully I can continue to travel the world 
            on my own someday.

          <p id="description">Ever since I was really little and just twirling around the house with scarves, 
            I've always had a passion for dance. Whether it was performing on stage with my 
            competitive team, at a rally with my high school class, or in the quad with my kpop 
            dance club, I had so much fun expressing myself through movement. Sometimes the 
            competitive nature of the dance world got to me, but I would turn back to low-pressure 
            dance environments with friends to remind me of the happiness it brought me.
