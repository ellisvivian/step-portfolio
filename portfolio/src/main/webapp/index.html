        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Vivian, a rising sophomore at Rice University studying Computer Science. 
        </p>
        <p>At Rice, I am part of RiceApps, an organization where we code projects to improve the lives of Rice students and the greater Houston community.
          I am also a member of Torque, the women's ultimate frisbee team, which I decided to join in an effort to try something new after spending most of
          my life as a dancer. Because I have so much love for the warm and welcoming community Rice is, I am also a lunch host for prospective students, 
          and I will be welcoming new students as an advisor during our orientation week this August. I can most commonly be found at my favorite place on 
          campus, the Wiess College commons, just studying and laughing with friends. 
        </p>
        <p>Back at my home in Cupertino, California, I spend much of my time with family and friends, exploring new places and trying new boba shops. 
          When I'm not coding I'm happy to pass the time with a good book, a bike ride around the neighborhood, or my favorite movie, Shrek 2. 
        </p>
